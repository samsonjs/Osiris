# Osiris

A multipart form encoder for Swift, as well as some other utilities that make
working with HTTP a bit simpler and more flexible.

# Installation

Copy the files you want to use into your project, and then customize them to suit your needs.

# Multipart Form Encoding

Create an encoder and then add parts to it as needed:

```Swift
let encoder = MultipartFormEncoder()
try! encoder.addText(name: "email", text: "somebody@example.com")
try! encoder.addText(name: "password", text: "secret")
let avatarData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(avatar, 1)!
encoder.addBinary(name: "avatar.jpg", contentType: "image/jpeg", data: avatarData)
```

You can encode the entire form as `Data` in memory if it's not very big:

```Swift
let encoded = try encoder.encodeToMemory()
var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/accounts")!)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.httpBody = encoded.body
request.addValue(encoded.contentType, forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
request.addValue("\(encoded.contentLength)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Length")
// ... whatever you normally do with requests
```

For larger forms you can also stream the encoded form data directly to disk:

```Swift
let path = NSTemporaryDirectory().appending("/form.data")
let encoded = try encoder.encodeToDisk(path: path)
var request = URLRequest(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/accounts")!)
request.httpMethod = "POST"
request.addValue(encoded.contentType, forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
request.addValue("\(encoded.contentLength)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Length")
let task = URLSession.shared.uploadTask(with: request, fromFile: encoded.bodyFileURL) { maybeData, maybeResponse, maybeError in

}
task.resume()

```

You can create and add your own parts using the `MultipartFormEncoder.Part` struct and `MultipartFormEncoder.addPart(_ part: Part)`.

# HTTPRequest

Basic usage:

```Swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com")!
let request = HTTPRequest(method: .get, url: url)
```

Fancier usage:

```Swift
let url = URL(string: "https://example.com")!
let params = ["email" : "someone@example.com", "password" : "secret"]
let request = HTTPRequest(method: .post, url: url, contentType: .json, parameters: params)
request.addHeader(name: "x-custom", value: "42")
request.addMultipartJPEG(name: "avatar", image: UIImage(), quality: 1, filename: "avatar.jpg")
```

You can build a `URLRequest` from an `HTTPRequest` instance using `RequestBuilder`. Or make your own builder.

# HTTPResponse

This enum makes sense of the 3 parameters of `URLSession`'s completion block. Its initializer takes in the optional `URLResponse`, `Data`, and `Error` values and determines if the request succeeded or failed, taking the HTTP status code into account. 200-level statuses are successes and anything else is a failure.

The success case has two associated values: `HTTPURLResponse` and `Data?`, while the failure case has three associated values: `Error`, `HTTPURLResponse`, and `Data?`.

Some properties are exposed for convenience:

- `data`: the optional body data returned by the server.

- `status`: the HTTP status code returned by the server, or 0 if the request itself failed, e.g. if the server cannot be reached.

- `headers`: a dictionary of headers.

- `bodyString`: the response body as a `String`. This is an empty string if the body is empty or there was an error decoding it as UTF8.

- `dictionaryFromJSON`: the decoded body for JSON responses. This is an empty dictionary if the body is empty or there was an error decoding it as a JSON dictionary.

- `underlyingResponse`: the `HTTPURLResponse` in case you need to dive in.

# RequestBuilder

This class takes in an `HTTPRequest` instance and turns it into a `URLRequest` for use with `URLSession`.

Usage:

```Swift
let urlRequest: URLRequest
do {
    urlRequest = try RequestBuilder.build(request: request)
}
catch {
    log.error("Invalid request \(request): \(error)")
    return
}
// ... do something with urlRequest
```

It encodes multipart requests in memory, so you'll need to change it or make your own builder for advanced functionality like encoding multipart forms to disk instead.

# FormEncoder

This was lifted from [Alamofire][], but with some minor changes.

```Swift
let body = FormEncoder.encode(["email" : "someone@example.com", "password" : "secret"])
// => "email=someone%40example.com&password=secret"
```

# Service: Putting it all Together

Take a look at `Service.swift` to see how it can all come together. Grafting your specific service API onto the primitives shown there is an exercise. In 1SE we're just adding methods to `Service` for each specific call, but you could keep them separate instead if you prefer that.

I don't recommend you use `Service` as shown here, but maybe use it as a jumping off point for something that makes sense to you for your specific application.
